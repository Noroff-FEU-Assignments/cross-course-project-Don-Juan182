    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise my client to secure his/her website by implementing some practices that will protect and secure the website like sanitization of data by a 
        well-known third-party solution like for example OR Mog NodeJS, securing authorization and authentication by using a two-factor authentication like OneLogin. In addition, I would
         integrate and deliver an automatic process to run code for changes that does not pass checks, for this I can use GitHub Action. Finally, I would make sure for the back-end team
          to implement an automatic user timeout so the user who left their credentials and some other sensitive information hanging can be automatically log out or redirected to a safe page in the browser.</p>
